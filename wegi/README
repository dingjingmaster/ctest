Some concepts:
1. The EGI mainly focus on EGI_IMG type data processing and PAGE managing/displaying, 
   Always try to avoid processing other type data and handling other events.

2. The APP will handle/process its own business data, and convert it to EGI_IMG type if
   it needs graphic displaying.

3. or, The EGI prepare/set PAGE environment according to APP's request, then the APP
   will use EGI interface to displaying any content by itself. ERING will be applied
   as a way of IPC.

4. The APP consists of two kinds of components: EGI_UI PAGEs, and executable APP files.
   They will be forked and launched as child processes of homepage program.
   By such a way that we can code and develop APPs independently, To install them, we only
   need to inform homepage programe its icons and bin file location/address.
   An example: wegi/app/app_ffplay 

5. All child processes to be handled by ULOOP_PROCESSE, as possible?.


NOTE:
1. Difference between OpenWRT uClibc and Glibc may cause some trouble!?
2. In uClibc calling malloc(0) returns NULL, while Glibc returs a vlid pointer? same
   situation for realloc().
3. uClibc runs on MMU-less systems.
